Week 7
--------
Congratulations and welcome to Week 7 of the bootcamp! We are so glad that you have made it so far even though it was tough at the beginning! The slides will give you an overview of the week and we also have a welcome video by our beloved mentors for our Day 1 of Rails! :) We hope you will have an exciting time learning Rails over the remaining weeks of the bootcamp!
