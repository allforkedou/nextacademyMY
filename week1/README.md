Over these 2 weeks, you will be working on various challenges designed to help you to think like a programmer and familiarise yourself with Ruby syntax.

As you work through the exercises, pay attention to your learning style and the way you communicate your problems to your mentors. Work out any adjustments that might need to be done so that you get better at solving problems.  

There will be some mathematical problems in these challenges - some of you may not have enjoyed maths during your school days, but don’t let that hinder you from learning how to code! Math problems are helpful in shaping your computational thinking, and that’s why we placed them here!

Many graduates have always told us these 2 weeks were the hardest, but it was also equally rewarding as they solved each challenge, step by step. We know that you can do it too!
