This is a question repo for testing your web server understanding related to Ruby. You'll be building a clone of Facebook, focusing on the backend server application. The goal of the assessment is to test your understanding of Active Record, Active Record Relationships and Associations, RESTful Routes and MVC through the use of the Sinatra framework, and thus the usage of Active Record, RESTFful Routes and MVC is a **requirement**.
