With your PairBnB pretty much set up, we will be adding a couple more features to your app and finally, we can deploy the app on Day 4! Note that the deployment process for a Rails app will be quite different from deploying your Sinatra app. 

Remember the rspec tests you encountered from Week 1 - Week 4? Yup, we will be learning how to write that for app testing. We don’t want our app in production to be buggy whenever we add/edit a certain feature. A good developer will make sure that tests are written for their app. In fact, almost half of the time in web development involves writing tests! So get your gear on and let’s get started!
