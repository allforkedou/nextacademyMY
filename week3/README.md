We are entering Week 3 of the bootcamp. This weekâ€™s challenges will be all about objects and classes - after all, Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. Please make sure you understand the concepts as you will be dealing with classes from now until the end of the bootcamp, and even after the bootcamp as you embark on your journey of becoming a developer!
