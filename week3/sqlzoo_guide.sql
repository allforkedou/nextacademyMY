-- SUM AND COUNT
-- ************************************************
-- This tutorial is about aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM and AVG. An aggregate function takes many values and delivers just one value. For example the function SUM would aggregate the values 2, 4 and 5 to deliver the single value 11.
-- Show the total population of the world.
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world

-- List all the continents - just once each.
SELECT DISTINCT continent

SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM world WHERE area>=1000000

-- What is the total population of ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')
SELECT SUM(population)
FROm world WHERE name in ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')

-- Useful Using GROUP BY and HAVING.
--------------------
-- For each continent show the number of countries:
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent

-- For each continent show the total population:
SELECT continent, SUM(population)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent

-- WHERE and GROUP BY. The WHERE filter takes place before the aggregating function. For each relevant continent show the number of countries that has a population of at least 200000000.
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
  FROM world
 WHERE population>200000000
 GROUP BY continent

 -- GROUP BY and HAVING. The HAVING clause is tested after the GROUP BY. You can test the aggregated values with a HAVING clause. Show the total population of those continents with a total population of at least half a billion
 SELECT continent, SUM(population)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population)>500000000
--------------------

-- For each continent show the continent and number of countries.
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
GROUP BY continent

-- For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)

-- Select the statement that shows the medium population density of each region
 SELECT region, SUM(population)/SUM(area) AS density FROM bbc GROUP BY region

-- Useful Select the statement that shows the name and population density of the country with the largest population
 SELECT name, population/area AS density FROM bbc WHERE population = (SELECT MAX(population) FROM bbc)
